Existing Features

•	The Book-up Page
o	This page provides information of the different packages available for events. It also allows the user to send a booking request for their special event. There are specific fields set up so the band receives the information needed to see if the event is possible, and also a box for custom text so the user can submit additional information. 

These are two images from the actual Booking us page:

Gigs
In the gigs page, site visitors can find information of upcoming events and gigs. Other pictures of the band are placed next to the text, and there is also a video that the band recorded and is publically available in YouTube. This is to provide the visitors a more in depth experience of the band and their music.

Future features:
•	A feature that would be good to implement in future would be a booking system for the gigs for the band.
•	Another feature would be a page where the band can present their merchandaise and accept orders for it.


<strong>Testing<strong>
I used the validator <strong>https://validator.w3.org/<strong> to test the HTML with the live link: <strong>https://lidiamorejudo.github.io/MilestoneProject1LidiaMorejudo/<strong><br>

Once the live link put in the box and I clicked enter, 13 warnings and errors appeared. The first ones I dealt with were the warnings.<br>

![ Warnings](/assets/img/HTMLcodewarnings.png)
<br>
1. The first warning was informing that the HTML document was missing the language tag. So, I added this in all pages. <br>

2. The second was an advisory more than a warning. It was a reminder that the trailing slash / at the end of selfclosing elements is not needed in HTML5. I have removed this slash. <br>

3 ot 5 These warnings advise me that there is no heading in the sections mentioned. However, the first section contains the image of the band and the main heading for the page is on another section. I don't want another heading for this image. Therefore, I am not adding another header. I don't want a specific header for the other sections either.

This image shows the errors found by the checker in the index page.<br>

![ Errors](/assets/img/HTMLcodeerrorsindex.png)

6. This error reminds me that I have closed the nested tags in the incorrect order.I had an "i" tag inside the "a" tag, but I had closed he "a" tag first, leaving the "i" tag outside incorrectly. I have corrected this now in the index page an other pages as this was in the footer with the social media links.


<strong>Deployment<strong>
<br>
I deployed the project using Github. This is what I did to deploy it:<br>

1.	I logged in to my GitHub Repository.<br>
2.	Then went to 'Settings'.<br>
3.	In 'Settings' I selected 'Pages'.<br>
4.	Found 'Source' and selected 'None' in the dropdown menu and then 'Main Branch'.<br>
5.	After the page was refreshed the life link appeared in the 'GitHub Pages' section. <br>
