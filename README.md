This website "Kiss Me Killer". Is the website for the music band called "Kiss Me Killer". The main purpose of the website is to publizise the band, keep in touch with fans by providing details of the gigs and upcoming performances, and reach out to potential customers who might want to hire the band for their events. 

The inherent value of the website for users is to have a portal of communication with a band they follow for fans. They can find information about how to contact them, and where and when they can see them play. For potential customers, the website presents pictures and video of the band. This way potential hirers can have a better idea of their style and looks, and decide if they match their event.

I chose this Kiss Me Killer band as the topic for this first project is because it's an actual band. All the images and video are from real gigs and commercial shots taken for the band. In this regard, a website showcasing their music and stetics for current fans and future event clients feels a project that might be requested in real life.

The colour of the website is influence by the logo of the band, which is read, and a black simple background, not too busy, helps to bring to the fore the images and stetics of the band. The font was also selected for this reason to match the mixed style of the band.

DEPLOYMENT:
I planned to create a webstie for the band Kiss Me Killer. To do this, first I created a plan for the different pages using wireframes in Balsamiq. Which helped me have a more visual represenation of what I wanted to achive. 
While developing the site, I came accross differnet issues that I had to overcome. For instance, initially I had the top menu framed in a colour band, which meant that when scrolling the page upwards some information would be hidden. This I changed for no colour. 
I had some issues with the favicon. It appeared on the tab when one was on the index pages but not on the others. I checked how the code for the favicon was used and realised that it was inserted in the head, which meant it had to be copied on each HTML page separately. Once I did this, the favicon appeared on all pages. 
I also had some issues getting the pictures to appear. I reached out the tutor help at the CodeInstitute. With this I learned that adding or not having a forward slash in the address pointing to where the picture is store is important for the computer to know where it is.
Achieving the right size for pictures and containers proved a bit of a struggle at times. I managed to get the appropriate sizing by testing with different margins and paddings. 

In terms of the navigation bar. I decided to have it fixed, so itÂ´s always visible. I am aware that on many other websites the navigation bar moves up when on scrolls down. However, I wanted my users to always be able to access it without having to keep scrolling up and down. Equally, there are effectively two links for the home page. One can access it by clicking the logo, and also "Home". I prefer this set up, as some people will click on the logo and expect to take them to the home page, but many users will also expect to have it spelt out in "Home".
